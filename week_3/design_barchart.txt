Design choices barchart

I chose the color 'coral' as the main color of the chart.
I picked this color because the chart represents hours of work
so I wanted it to be a busy color but not too shouting.

For the tooltip I picked colors that would give a nice balance and are not busy.
The interactivity of the tooltip popping up and the bar changing color is already busy
so I wanted the tooltip to have calm colors like blue grey and white.

I chose this orientation of the axes because it fits better for the months of the year.
